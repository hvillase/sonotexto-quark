# sonotexto-quark
This quark contains the SonoTexto, SampleTexto, and Ptexto classes developed as part of Hernani Villase√±or's Ph.D. research project in music technology at UNAM.  
**SonoTexto:** records and saves sounds in the \<sonotexto> folder.  
**SampleText:** reads sounds from a folder by their index number and creates a SynthDef for each mono and stereo sound.  
**Text:** is a pattern based on the module operation.
