# sonotexto-quark
This quark contains the SonoTexto, SampleTexto, and Ptexto classes developed with SuperCollider as part of Hernani Villase√±or's Ph.D. research project in [Music Technology UNAM](https://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/).  
**SonoTexto:** records and saves sounds in the \<sonotexto> folder.  
**SampleTexto:** reads sounds from a folder by their index number and creates a SynthDef for each mono and stereo sound in the folder.  
**Ptexto:** is a SuperCollider pattern based on the module operation.
