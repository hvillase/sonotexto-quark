# sonotexto-quark
This quark contains the SonoTexto, SampleTexto, and Ptexto classes developed as part of Hernani Villase√±or's Ph.D. research project in [Music Technology UNAM](https://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/).  
**SonoTexto:** records and saves sounds in the \<sonotexto> folder.  
**SampleTexto:** reads sounds from a folder by their index number and creates a SynthDef for each mono and stereo sound.  
**Ptexto:** is a pattern based on the module operation.  
	
# Installation
1 Download the quark and place it in the quark folder in Extensions.   
2 Create folders named \<sonotexto> and \<sampletexto> and place them in the Recordings path in SuperCollider.
